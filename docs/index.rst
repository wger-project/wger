Welcome to wger Workout Manager's documentation!
================================================

wger is a free, open source web application that manages your exercises and
personal workouts, weight and nutrition. It can also be used as a simple gym
management utility, providing different administrative roles (trainer, manager,
etc.). It offers a REST API as well, for easy integration with other projects
and tools. It is written with python/django and uses jQuery and some D3js for charts.

For more details and a live system, refer to the project's site:

This documentation is intended for developers and administrators of the software.
