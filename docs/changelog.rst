.. warning ::
   There have been some changes to the installation procedure. Calling 'invoke'
   on its own has been deprecated, you should use the 'wger' command (which
   accepts the same options). Also some of these commands have been renamed:

   * ``start_wger`` to ``wger``
   * ``bootstrap_wger`` ``bootstrap``

Upgrade steps from 1.7:

* Django update to 1.9: ``pip install -r requirements.txt``
* Database upgrade: ``python manage.py migrate``
* Reset cache: ``python manage.py clear-cache --clear-all``
* Due to changes in the JS package management, you have to delete
  wger/core/static/bower_components and do a ``python manage.py bower install``
* Update static files (only production): ``python manage.py collectstatic``
* Load new the languages fixtures as well as their configuration
  ``python manage.py loaddata languages`` and
  ``python manage.py loaddata language_config``

  your instance has its own twitter account.
