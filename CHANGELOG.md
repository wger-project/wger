# Changelog for the next release

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This release comes with some breaking changes for self-hoster. Please read carefully.

## New features

### Double progression
Progression requirements can now reference the top of the prescribed range via the new rules `max_repetitions` and `max_weight`, and the new `all_sets` flag requires every prescribed set to qualify. Together they enable classic double progression schemes ("work from 8 to 12 reps at a fixed weight, add weight only once all sets reach 12"), e.g. `{"rules": ["max_repetitions"], "all_sets": true}`.

### Bug fixes

* Deleting a routine, day, slot, or slot entry now preserves completed workout
  sessions and logs, including performed and target values. Only the references
  to deleted routine structure are cleared. Explicit session deletion and account
  deletion continue to remove the corresponding history. Apply the usual database
  migrations when upgrading; previously deleted history cannot be restored by
  this change.

## New settings
*(for self-hoster)*

* ...

## Breaking API changes
*(only relevant if you have your own scripts or interact with the REST API)*

* Creating exercises via `POST /api/v2/exercise/` now requires the `add_exercise`
  permission. Regular users should use `/api/v2/exercise-submission/`, which
  creates the exercise together with at least one translation.
