No software is perfect. For some severe errors, an email will be automatically sent, but
not always, so I depend on you reporting everything that didn't behave as expected.
Please describe in as much detail as you can what you were doing when the error
happened.

{% blocktrans %}If you found a problem, please
<a href="https://bitbucket.org/rolandgeider/workout_manager/issues">report it
to the issue tracker</a> in bitbucket.

<p>{% blocktrans %}
The issue tracker can also be used to document enhancements to the software, so
if you have some suggestions, feel free to open a ticket, just set '<em>kind</em>'
to '<em>enhancement</em>'.
