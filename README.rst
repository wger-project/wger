Thank you for downloading wger Workout Manager. wger (ˈvɛɡɐ) is a free, open source web
application that manages your exercises and personal workouts, weight and diet
plans. It can also be used as a simple gym management utility, providing different
administrative roles (trainer, manager, etc.). It offers a REST API as well, for
easy integration with other projects and tools.

It is written with python/django and uses jQuery and some D3js for charts.

For more details and a live system, refer to the project's site: https://wger.de/


Installation
============

These are the basic steps to install and run the application locally on a linux
system. There are more detailed instructions, other deployment options as well
as an administration guide available at https://wger.readthedocs.io or locally
in your code repository in the docs folder (``make html`` to compile, then open
_build/index.html).

Please consult the commands' help for further information and available
parameters.


Docker
------

Useful to just try it out::

    docker run -ti --name wger.apache --publish 8000:80 wger/apache

Then just open http://localhost:8000 and log in as: **admin**, password **admin**

Alternatively, there are docker images for development as well, ``wger/devel``
and ``wger/devel-fedora``. Both images contain an instance of the application
running with django's development server using a sqlite database and  can be
used to quickly setup a development instance (vim and tmux are already
installed). The only difference is that devel has an ubuntu base image while
devel-fedora uses fedora.

::

 $ docker run -ti --name wger.devel --publish 8000:8000 wger/devel

Then, *within the docker image*, activate the virtualenv

::

  $ source ~/venv/bin/activate

and start the development server

::

 $ python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000

Then just open http://localhost:8000 and log in as: **admin**, password **admin**


Development version (from git)
------------------------------

**Note:** You can safely install from master, it is almost always in a usable
and stable state.


1) Install the necessary packages

::

 $ sudo apt-get install python3-dev python-virtualenv nodejs nodejs-legacy npm libjpeg8-dev zlib1g-dev git


Then install the python packages from pypi in the virtualenv::

 $ virtualenv --python python3 venv-django
 $ source venv-django/bin/activate


2) Start the application. This will download the required JS and CSS libraries
   and create a SQlite database and populate it with data on the first run.

::

 $ git clone https://github.com/wger-project/wger.git
 $ cd wger
 $ pip install -r requirements.txt  # or requirements_devel.txt to develop
 $ python setup.py develop
 $ wger create_settings \
        --settings-path /path/to/current/folder/settings.py \
        --database-path /path/to/current/folder/database.sqlite
 $ wger bootstrap \
        --settings-path /path/to/current/folder/settings.py \
        --no-start-server
 $ python manage.py runserver

3) Log in as: **admin**, password **admin**

After the first run you can just use django's development server::

 $ python manage.py runserver


Stable version (from PyPI)
--------------------------

1) Install the necessary packages and their dependencies in a virtualenv

::

 $ sudo apt-get install python3-dev python-virtualenv nodejs nodejs-legacy npm libjpeg8-dev zlib1g-dev
 $ virtualenv venv-django
 $ source venv-django/bin/activate
 $ pip install wger


2) Start the application. This will download the required JS and CSS libraries
   and create a SQlite database and populate it with data on the first run.
   Then, log in as: **admin**, password **admin**
::

 $ wger bootstrap


3) To start the installation again, just call wger start::

  $ wger start
