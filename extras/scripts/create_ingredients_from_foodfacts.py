"""
Simple script that imports and loads the Open Food Facts database into the
ingredients database.

NOTE: The file is VERY large (17 GB), so it takes a long time (> 3 hours) to
import the data and create all the ingredients.


* Requirements:
(note that the local mongo version needs to be compatible with the one used to
 create the dump, otherwise the indices won't be compatible, it is best to use
 a newer version than the one found in the ubuntu/debian repos)

pip3 install pymongo
apt-get install mongo-tools zip

* Steps:
wget https://static.openfoodfacts.org/data/openfoodfacts-mongodbdump.tar.gz
tar xzvf openfoodfacts-mongodbdump.tar.gz

# Import
docker pull mongo
docker run -it --name wger_mongo -p 27017:27017 -d  \
    -e MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME=off \
    -e MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD=off-wger \
    mongo:latest
mongorestore --username off --password off-wger -d admin -c products dump/off/products.bson

# Process
python extras/scripts/create_ingredients_from_foodfacts.py

# Cleanup
docker stop wger_mongo
docker rm wger_mongo
rm openfoodfacts-mongodbdump.tar.gz
rm -r dump

# Update ingredient fixture
python3 manage.py dumpdata nutrition.ingredient > extras/scripts/data.json
cd extras/scripts/
